# Package Export Rule

Every completed AQOS package should expose its completed public classes through its package-level `__init__.py`.

Example:

```python
from aqos.evaluation import EvaluationPipeline
```

This keeps imports clean, consistent, and stable across the codebase.

# Architecture Notes

## Strategy stop-loss vs Risk stop-loss

AQOS has two different stop-loss concepts:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `strategy/stop_loss.py` | Strategy-level stop-loss planning |
| `risk/stop_loss.py` | Account-level stop-loss validation and risk control |

## Strategy take-profit vs Risk take-profit

AQOS has two different take-profit concepts:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `strategy/take_profit.py` | Strategy-level take-profit planning |
| `risk/take_profit.py` | Risk-adjusted take-profit calculation and validation |

This separation prevents strategy logic from being mixed with portfolio/account risk controls.

---

# Maintenance Rules

1. Every new source file must be added to this document.
2. Every renamed file must be updated here.
3. Every deleted file must be removed here.
4. Package-level `__init__.py` files must export completed public classes.
5. Status must always match the repository.
6. Update this document once per completed sprint.

---

# Notes

`CODEBASE.md` is the authoritative inventory of the AQOS repository.

The Evaluation subsystem was completed in Sprint 009. It now includes evaluation metrics, lightweight backtesting, walk-forward validation, paper trading simulation, evaluation reports, and a unified evaluation pipeline.

The current Evaluation implementation is intentionally lightweight and deterministic. Later phases will add realistic backtesting features such as slippage, commissions, broker fill simulation, benchmark comparison, Monte Carlo analysis, advanced performance metrics, and visual reporting.

Files such as `continual.py`, `evaluator.py`, `reinforcement.py`, and `self_supervised.py` remain intentionally deferred learning modules. They will be implemented only after their prerequisite systems are available.

Whenever the repository structure changes, this document must be updated before a sprint is considered complete.
